description:
  summary: Program for compiling rockframes written in YAML to rockspecs.
  detailed: >
    daelvn/rockwriter stopped working for me, so
    I ended up making this. It takes a YAML "rockframe",
    and compiles it into a rockspec by providing a version.
    It can also test the rock or upload it for you!
